Simplicity
==========

Simplicity is the sample layout for cargBags 2, designed to give a good start on the framework - very simple with lots of comments, still showing most of the important features.

It features an "all-in-one" approach to inventory management, meaning one single bag for your character's inventory and another one for the bank. The keyring is not included here, because I don't think you really need it in your inventory, but cargBags would support, just in case you would want to add it.
Each container features a TagDisplay for showing your free vs. used slots and another one for your current money at the top. Clicking each one of these toggles a search bar which supports different intelligent rules. In addition, each container also features a bar of bagbuttons for swapping the 'real' bags.

Feel free to modify this addon to your liking, it comes without any license and I don't claim any rights. Quite the contrary: It would be great if you release your own layout and so encourage users to start developing their own! In any case you might want to take a look at the [cargBags wiki](http://github.com/xconstruct/cargBags/wiki) for more info and help (or even to contribute)!
